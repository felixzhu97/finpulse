    "varExplanation": "At 95% confidence, portfolio daily loss may exceed this percentage. For example, -0.39% means there's a 5% chance of losing more than 0.39% in a single day.",
    "riskOverview": "Risk Overview",
    "currentValue": "Current Value",
    "volatilityDescription": "Volatility measures the degree of variation in portfolio or asset prices over time. Annualized volatility is typically expressed as a percentage, with higher values indicating greater price fluctuations and higher risk. Lower volatility generally means more stable returns but may also imply lower potential gains.\n\nExample: If a portfolio has an annualized volatility of 18%, it means the portfolio's value may fluctuate within ±18% of its average over a year. For instance, if a portfolio is worth $100,000 with 18% volatility, its value could range between $82,000 and $118,000 over the year.",
    "sharpeRatioDescription": "The Sharpe ratio is a key metric for measuring risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio. It calculates the excess return per unit of risk taken. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better returns for the same level of risk. Generally, a Sharpe ratio above 1 is considered good, and above 2 is considered excellent.\n\nExample: If a portfolio has a Sharpe ratio of 1.25, it means for every 1% of risk taken, the portfolio earns 1.25% in excess returns. For instance, if the risk-free rate is 3%, portfolio return is 15%, and volatility is 10%, then Sharpe ratio = (15% - 3%) / 10% = 1.2.",
    "varDescription": "Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure that quantifies the maximum potential loss a portfolio might suffer within a given time period at a specific confidence level. For example, a VaR of -2% at 95% confidence means there's 95% certainty that losses won't exceed 2%, but a 5% chance that losses could exceed this value. VaR helps investors understand their portfolio's potential risk exposure.\n\nExample: If a portfolio has a VaR of $2,500 at 95% confidence, it means in 95% of cases, daily losses won't exceed $2,500. For instance, if a portfolio is worth $100,000 with a VaR of $2,500, there's a 95% probability that daily losses won't exceed 2.5%, but a 5% chance losses could exceed this amount.",
    "betaDescription": "Beta measures a portfolio's sensitivity to overall market movements. A beta of 1 means the portfolio moves in sync with the market; beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility than the market (higher risk and potential returns); beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility than the market (lower risk and returns). A beta of 0 means no correlation with the market, and negative beta indicates inverse movement relative to the market.\n\nExample: If a portfolio has a beta of 1.05, when the market rises 10%, the portfolio may rise 10.5%; when the market falls 10%, the portfolio may fall 10.5%. For instance, if the market index rises 5%, a portfolio with beta 1.05 may rise 5.25%. If beta is 0.8, when the market rises 10%, the portfolio may only rise 8%.",
    "computedVarDescription": "Computed VaR is a risk value calculated using statistical methods based on the portfolio's historical data. This value reflects the portfolio's risk characteristics over a past period and helps predict potential future loss ranges. The calculation method considers the distribution and volatility of historical returns, providing a more accurate risk assessment.\n\nExample: If the computed VaR is -0.0039 (i.e., -0.39%), at 95% confidence, it means there's a 95% probability that daily losses won't exceed 0.39%. For instance, if a portfolio is worth $100,000 with a VaR of -0.39%, there's a 95% probability that daily losses won't exceed $390, but a 5% chance losses could exceed this amount. This value is calculated based on the past 90 days of historical data.",
