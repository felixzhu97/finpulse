# ER Diagram

Conceptual entity-relationship diagram for a generic fintech system (customers, accounts, portfolios, instruments, orders, trades, payments, settlement, market data, risk metrics). The diagram is defined in PlantUML Information Engineering notation.

A Chinese copy is available in [docs_ch/er-diagram](../../docs_ch/er-diagram/).

To generate an image from `er-diagram.puml`, use the PlantUML CLI or an IDE plugin:

```bash
plantuml docs/er-diagram/er-diagram.puml
```

Output will be written next to the source file (e.g. `er-diagram.png`). You can also paste the file contents into the [PlantUML online server](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/) to view or export.
